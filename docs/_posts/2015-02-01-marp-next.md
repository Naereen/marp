## We're working toward Marp Next!

[marp-team](https://github.com/marp-team) is working about full-rewritten Marp! Our projects are modern, maintainable, and usable in various situations.

- Our [**core**](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core) is based on the our brand-new [**Marpit framework**](https://marpit.marp.app)
- [Theme CSS with clean markup](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css) is supported in Marpit
- [**CLI interface**](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) can export PDF and [HTML slide](https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example)
- Web interface and desktop app to replace current Marp are [planning now!](https://github.com/marp-team/marp)

Currently most of these are not ready to use, but we progress step-by-step to realize better presentation writing by the plain Markdown. Don't miss it!
